# Things I found interesting:

- I find it interesting that the president mentioned the prices of agricultural products and how the prices won't go down so that the farmers will still get profit and how they plan on chasing after the people who manipulates the prices of rice or other agricultural products and how he calls their action **economical sabotage**.  
- I find it interesting that they actually lessened the documents you need to be a teacher and also digitalized the remaining paperwork. I know how it feels because my mom is a teacher herself and it would be more simple if they lessened the  unnecessary files and if a lot of the paper work would be online.
    
# Things I found weird:
- I found it weird that the the president said that he will make high tech devices and accessible wifi more accessible because the "high tech devices" are probably not even going to perform well but at least it is something.

# Reflection: 
The SONA was well spoken and very informative. President Bongbong Marcos did a good job at addressing most of the problems. He addressed some things that I didn't expect him to address like how much he talked about agriculture and how he put it first. He was very specific with his topics and addressed the small issues like how he talked about the documents you need to be a teacher and how he lessened them.

My worry for this is that the president made a lot of promises. It's hard to believe that all these things will come true because of how expensive these projects will cost and how many there are. He mentioned the implementation of solar panels to increase the use of renewable energy but the installation of solar panels are very expensive which makes it hard to do with the budget of the Philippines. He also mentioned that high tech devices like cellphones, tablets, laptops, etc. will be more accessible to students and teachers but it's hard to accomplish unless the devices they will be providing won't be the best performing ones.
