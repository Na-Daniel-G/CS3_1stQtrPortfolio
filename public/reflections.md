## **1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.**
### 1. Arithmetic Operators: 
These are the mathematical processes like addition, subtraction, multiplication, divission and more used to manipulate numbers. I am very confident in this lesson because it is easy to use and very simple and basic.
### 2. Conditional Statements (if-else):
These are used to do different actions based on the condition. You would use if, else if and else for this. I belive I am confident in this topic because I have already done this in previous years and I am very familiar with how it works.
### 3. Switch function:
This is a more clean alternative compared to using multiple repeating else if statements. It works by checking the expression then compares it to all of the cases, if it doesn't match any the code in the **default** would be done. 
### 4. Relational and Logical Operators
These are used to set the conditions for the conditional and switch functions. It works by comparing two values together. The logical operators are used to combine multiple relational conditions together to make one big condition. 
### 5. Variable Decleration and Data types 
A data type specifies what kind of value is stored in the variable like integer, string, character or more. Java script is very lenient when comparing two data types like if you say 5 == "5" it will come out true. 

## **2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.**
### 1. Loops:
This is a control flow structure that repeats an action until a condition is met. I need more practice with this because I sometimes get confused when there are multiple nested loops involeved.
### 2. Arrays:
This is used to store a collection of elemnts with the same data type under the same base name, it helps programmers organize repeating variables more. My struggle for this also has something to do with using loops because sometimes my head gets jumbled up when there are too many variables involved.
### 3. Functions:
A function is a block of code that does a certain task which can also be called multiple times. I sturggle with this topic because of how many types of functions there actually are, I get confused on which one I should use. 
### 4. HTML style sheet
This basically controls how the html elements will be displayed on the website. It determines the margins, shapes, sizes, colors, images, etc. I need more practice with this because I am not familiar with the syntax yet and this is very dependent on your knowledge with the syntax. 
### 5. Number Properties
These are the values are built in to the Number() object. It is a simple topic but I just need to memorize the properties more. 
## **3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**
I would try to do more practice problems involving them like making more codes involving loops and arrays to make me more familiar with them. I just need more hands on practice.
## **4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
I think the activities with my group mates like the "make the right code that displays this triangle" activity or the ones where we help each other out to learn the code more is very fun. The ones I didn't like the most were the ones where we had to do a lot of things alone like the bonus task with the website personal home page or the SONA reflection because although they were fun I believe that coding is better when you colaborate with other people because you learn more together than alone.
